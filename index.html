            <p>
              Hi, I'm Paula, a self-taught full-stack developer with almost a
              year of experience. Prior to learning how to code, I worked as a
              chemist in the food industry, where I was responsible for the R&D
              and quality departments. This role gave me the opportunity to
              develop strong problem-solving skills, from technical issues to
              people conflicts. I found that working collaboratively with others
              and being able to think creatively to solve complex problems was
              what motivated me the most.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since transitioning into the tech industry, I have continued to
              build on my problem-solving skills and learned new technologies
              and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I have
              also been fortunate enough to work on several web development
              projects, where I was able to learn new skills and gain valuable
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to coding, I enjoy outdoor activities like hiking and
              diving, and I am an avid fan of heavy lifting. I find that these
              activities not only help me to stay physically fit, but also
              provide a welcome break from the digital world and inspire fresh
              ideas and perspectives.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thank you for taking the time to learn a little more about me. I'm
              excited to continue developing my skills in front and backend, and
              working collaboratively to create innovative solutions. Let's
              build something great together!
            </p>
