## Hello everyone :ocean:

### My name is Paula del Moral

And I'm excited to welcome you to my personal GitHub page! 

As a self-taught programmer, I've been exploring the world of full-stack and software development, and I'm eager to share my projects and experiences with you.

#### My Background :microscope:
My background is in chemistry, and I spent several years working in the food industry in R&D and Quality departments. Although I enjoyed my work, I realized that my hobbies and interests aligned more closely with the tech field. So, I decided to make a career transition and pursue my passion for programming.

#### The Challenge :tiger:
This journey has been really challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. 
I've developed strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail, which I believe are essential for success in the tech industry. As I continue to learn and grow as a programmer, my GitHub page will serve as a portfolio of my accomplishments and a reflection of my progress.


I'm excited to be part of the programming community and to contribute to it in my own way. I hope that my projects and insights can inspire and motivate others who are also pursuing a career in tech.

Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to connecting with you!
